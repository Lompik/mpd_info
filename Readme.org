#+TITLE: Display MPD (Music Media Player) current song info on screen [xcb]

* Motivation 

I was having some issues with [[https://github.com/brndnmtthws/conky/issues/103][conky]] when trying to display [[http://www.musicpd.org/][MPD]]'s current song information so I decided to create a *simple* replacement. 
I looked into implementing it in =python= however i wanted to play with c/autotools and the current packages for xcb (xpyb (deprecated i think) or xcffib) does not seem mature enough and undocumented (just like xcb).

* Installation
** dependencies
in order to build from source, you will need the following libraries (will be checked by autoconf):
  - pango
  - xcb
  - cairo
  - glib
  - libmpdclient
  - Font: [[https://fortawesome.github.io/Font-Awesome/][awesome]] (not checked! you'll notice if you dontr have it)

** Compiling

#+begin_src shell
aclocal ; autoheader; automake --add-missing; autoconf
./configure 
make 
#+end_src

* Configuration

a sample configuration file is given in the etc folder. it will only be read if copied to =~/.config/mpd_info=.
